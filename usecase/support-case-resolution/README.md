# `support-case-resolution` — asynchronous support case resolution

> **Domain:** Customer support automation · **Trigger:** REST API from a
> support portal or chatbot · **Connectors:** `ballerinax/salesforce`,
> `ballerinax/slack`, `ballerinax/googleapis.gmail`

## Scenario

A customer opens a support case from a portal, chatbot, or mobile app.
The workflow creates a Salesforce Case, keeps the customer updated by
email, notifies support engineering in Slack, and then pauses at several
checkpoints until external systems send the next event.

1. **Create a Salesforce Case** for the inbound support request.
2. **Email the customer** asking for diagnostic details.
3. **Notify support engineering** in Slack.
4. **Wait for diagnostics** from the customer portal or chatbot.
5. **Wait for engineer triage** from an internal support console.
6. If a product fix is required, **wait for a deployment webhook** from
   the release or CI/CD system.
7. **Wait for customer confirmation** that the issue is resolved.
8. **Close or update the Salesforce Case** and send the final email.

This use case demonstrates long-running workflow state without a custom
state table. The workflow runtime holds the execution state while the
case waits for customer messages, engineer decisions, and deployment
events. Each external callback resumes the correct checkpoint with the
workflow id.
