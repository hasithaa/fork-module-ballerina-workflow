// Durable agent (object model) — declaration surface
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A durable agent is declared once as a module-level `final` object whose
// constructor config carries every capability (activities, tools, events,
// human tasks, peers). The compiler plugin validates the declaration and
// generates the module-init registration; the agent itself runs on the
// existing durable ReAct loop.

# How a declared event channel consumes its requests.

    # The channel is consumed exactly once per run. Declare this only when the
    # channel receives a single event per agent instance — a later event on the
    # channel is never consumed
    SINGLE_EVENT,
    # The channel re-arms after every turn: the agent may wait on it repeatedly,
    # each wait consuming the next queued payload (default — events can originate
    # from multiple senders, which a once-only channel cannot guarantee)
    MULTI_EVENT
}

# One event channel of a durable agent, declared in the mapping form of `events`
# where the mapping key is the channel name — constant by construction, so the
# name needs no separate validation. `request`/`response` capture both sides'
# types and the channel's duplexity: a `response` type declares a duplex
# (request-response) channel whose turn answers are read with
# `getDataResult`/`waitForDataResult`; a nil `response` declares a one-way
# channel — data flows in, no result is read back.
#
# + request - Type of the payload sent to the agent on this channel; `sendData`
#             validates each payload against it

#
# + systemPrompt - The agent's identity: role + instructions (the per-run query
#                  is appended as the user turn by `run`)
# + model - The model provider used for the agent's LLM calls
# + activities - `@workflow:Activity` functions, bare or as `ActivityDecl` when
#                gating/roles/bindings are needed
# + tools - AI tools: `@ai:AgentTool` functions, `ai:ToolConfig`s, toolkits, or
#           `ToolDecl` when gating is needed
# + events - Event channels keyed by channel name (`{chat: {request: string,
#            response: string}}`)
# + humanTasks - Human task capabilities keyed by task name (`{signoff: {userRoles:
#                "manager"}}`)
#                Capability names share one namespace across activities, tools,
#                events, human tasks, and peers: a name claimed twice is rejected
#                when the agent registers, so the program fails at startup
# + peers - Peer durable agents advertised as delegable tools
# + maxIter - Hard cap on reasoning iterations per turn
# + eventTimeout - Maximum wait per event-channel wait (each chat turn, each event).
#                  Omit to wait indefinitely — a conversation stays open as long as it
#                  takes, and `maxEventWaits` remains the runaway backstop. On a timeout
#                  the model is told so it can wrap up gracefully
# + inputType - The type of the structured JSON payload the agent's `run` (and the
#               management API start) accepts alongside the query. `json` (the
#               default) accepts any JSON payload unvalidated; a narrower type —
#               typically a record — declares the payload's shape and is validated
#               against it at the call site and at run time; `()` declares a
#               no-payload agent whose only input is the query text
# + resultType - When declared, the agent produces a typed final result: as the
#                reasoning loop concludes, one more durable model call converts the
#                conversation outcome into this type, and `waitForResult`/`getResult`
#                return it. `()` keeps the final text response
