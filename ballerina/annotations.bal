# Marks a function as a workflow.

# ```ballerina
# @workflow:Workflow
# function orderProcess(Order input) returns OrderResult|error {
# }
# ```
public annotation Workflow on function;

# Marks a function as a workflow activity.

# Marks a function as a durable AI agent workflow. The agent runs as a durable
# workflow, so `@workflow:DurableAgent` implies `@workflow:Workflow` and must not
# be combined with it.
#
# The function receives a `workflow:AgentContext` as its first parameter, an
# input record, and an optional events record (`record {| future<T> ... |}`).
# It configures the agent imperatively — registering activities and human tasks
# on the context — and finally calls `ctx.runDurableAgent(...)`, which takes the
# same configuration as a regular `ai:Agent` (system prompt, model, AI tools).
# The function returns `error?`; a durable agent has no direct return value (it
# may run for days).
#
# ```ballerina
# @workflow:DurableAgent
# function processOrderAgent(workflow:AgentContext ctx, OrderRequest req) returns error? {
#     final ai:ModelProvider llm = check ai:getDefaultModelProvider();
#     check ctx.registerActivity(checkInventory);
#     check ctx.runDurableAgent(req.prompt,
#             systemPrompt = {role: "Order assistant", instructions: "Help the user with their order."},
#             model = llm);
# }
# ```
