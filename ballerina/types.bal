# Deployment mode for the workflow runtime.

# + LOCAL - Local development server (e.g., `temporal server start-dev`)

# Internal retry policy used to pass module-level defaults to the native layer.
# + initialIntervalInSeconds - Initial delay before the first retry attempt in seconds
# + backoffCoefficient - Multiplier applied to the interval after each retry
# + maximumIntervalInSeconds - Optional cap on the delay between retries in seconds
# + maximumAttempts - Maximum number of Temporal-level attempts (1 = no retries)

# Options for activity execution via `callActivity`.
#
# + retryOnError - If `true`, retry policy is applied when the activity fails:
#                  the engine retries the activity up to `maxRetries` times before
#                  propagating the failure to the workflow. Set to `false` (default)
#                  to receive any error as a normal return value so that the workflow
#                  can handle it with its own logic, without any automatic retries.
# + maxRetries - Number of times to retry the activity on failure (only used when
#               `retryOnError = true`). `0` means no retries — the activity runs
#               exactly once and its failure immediately propagates to the workflow.
# + retryDelay - Initial delay in seconds before the first retry (default: 1.0).
#               Only used when `retryOnError = true` and `maxRetries > 0`.
# + retryBackoff - Multiplier applied to `retryDelay` after each attempt (default: 2.0).
#                 `1.0` means a fixed interval; `2.0` doubles the delay each time.
#                 Only used when `retryOnError = true` and `maxRetries > 0`.
# + maxRetryDelay - Optional cap on the delay between retries, in seconds.
#                  Prevents exponential backoff from growing without limit.
#                  Only used when `retryOnError = true` and `maxRetries > 0`.
