# Handle Errors

In Ballerina, errors are first-class values — they are returned, inspected, and acted on like any other value. This is a deliberate design principle: **error handling is part of the business logic, not an afterthought**.

Workflows are long-running business processes, and failures are expected outcomes, not exceptional events. An activity that calls an external API may time out. A payment may be declined. An inventory check may return "out of stock". These are not crashes — they are results that your workflow should reason about explicitly.

## Where Errors Are Handled

An activity failure can be addressed in two places:

- **Inside the activity** — the activity handles the failure internally and returns a success result to the workflow. This is appropriate for low-level infrastructure retries that the workflow does not need to know about.
- **In the workflow** — the activity returns `T|error`, and the workflow decides what happens next: retry with different parameters, try an alternative path, compensate earlier steps, or wait for a human decision. This is the preferred pattern for business-significant failures, because the decision itself becomes part of the durable workflow history.

## Errors and Workflow State

When an activity returns an `error`, the `ballerina/workflow` module records an `ActivityTaskFailed` event in the workflow's history. This happens regardless of whether the workflow handles the error or propagates it — the failure is always visible in Temporal's event history and audit log before the workflow code sees the return value.

What happens next is determined entirely by the workflow code:

```ballerina
// The workflow receives the error as a plain value — what happens next is your choice
string|error result = ctx->callActivity(processPayment, {"amount": input.amount});
```

If the activity is configured with retries (`retryOnError = true`), Temporal retries the activity transparently. Each attempt is recorded in the history as an `ActivityTaskScheduled` event. Only after all retries are exhausted does the final error reach the workflow as a value.

Because every failure is a recorded event in an append-only log, workflows can recover from process restarts mid-execution and replay to exactly where they left off — giving you durability and full observability without extra instrumentation.

---

## Controlling Retries

By default (`retryOnError = false`), errors are returned immediately as values — no Temporal retries are attempted. This matches Ballerina's standard error-as-value model and is the right default for deterministic business failures (e.g., validation errors, "item not found").

Enable retries when the failure is transient (e.g., network timeouts, intermittent downstream outages):

```ballerina
// Default: error returned immediately as a value, no retries
string|error result = ctx->callActivity(chargeCard, {"amount": input.amount});

// Opt-in retries: Temporal retries the activity up to 3 times before returning the error
string|error retried = ctx->callActivity(chargeCard, {"amount": input.amount},
        retryOnError = true, maxRetries = 3, retryDelay = 2.0, retryBackoff = 1.5);
```

Regardless of whether retries are enabled, the final outcome is the same: the error arrives at the workflow as a `T|error` value. Retries never hide the error from the workflow code.

### Retry Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `retryOnError` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable Temporal-level retries |
| `maxRetries` | `int` | `0` | Maximum number of retry attempts (e.g., `3` means up to 3 retries after the initial attempt, for 4 total attempts) |
| `retryDelay` | `decimal` | `1.0` | Initial delay in seconds between retries |
| `retryBackoff` | `decimal` | `2.0` | Exponential backoff multiplier |
| `maxRetryDelay`| `decimal?`  | *(none)*| Cap on the delay between retries in seconds (optional) |

## Error Handling Patterns

### Propagate — Fail the Workflow

Use `check` to propagate the error. The workflow transitions to **Failed** in Temporal, all subsequent steps are skipped, and the caller of `workflow:getWorkflowResult()` receives the error. Use this pattern when the failure means the workflow cannot meaningfully continue — the full error, including any detail fields, is visible in the Temporal UI under the workflow's **Event History**.

```ballerina
@workflow:Workflow
function processOrder(workflow:Context ctx, OrderInput input) returns OrderResult|error {
    // If checkInventory returns an error, `check` propagates it immediately.
    // The workflow is marked Failed. confirmOrder is never called.
    boolean _ = check ctx->callActivity(checkInventory, {"item": input.item});
    string _ = check ctx->callActivity(confirmOrder, {"orderId": input.orderId});
    return {orderId: input.orderId, status: "COMPLETED"};
}
```

---

### Handle Inline — Inspect the Error Value

Capture the `T|error` return and branch on it. The workflow stays **Running** and continues executing. Use `result.message()` for the error message and pattern-match on specific error types for fine-grained handling.

```ballerina
@workflow:Workflow
function processOrder(workflow:Context ctx, OrderInput input) returns string|error {
    // Capture as T|error — the workflow stays Running regardless of the outcome
    string|error result = ctx->callActivity(checkStock, {"item": input.item});
    if result is error {
        // Handle the failure explicitly — workflow continues
        return "Out of stock: " + result.message();
    }
    return result;
}
```

---

### Fallback — Try an Alternative

When the primary activity exhausts its retries, fall back to a secondary path. The workflow completes successfully via the fallback.

```ballerina
@workflow:Workflow
function sendNotification(workflow:Context ctx, NotificationInput input) returns string|error {
    // Try primary with retries; capture the error rather than propagating
    string|error emailResult = ctx->callActivity(sendEmail,
            {"to": input.email, "message": input.message},
            retryOnError = true, maxRetries = 2, retryDelay = 1.0, retryBackoff = 2.0);

    if emailResult is error {
        // Primary exhausted — fall back to SMS. `check` means: fail if SMS also fails.
        return check ctx->callActivity(sendSms,
                {"phone": input.phone, "message": input.message});
    }

    return emailResult;
}
```

### Compensation (Saga Pattern) — Undo Completed Steps

When a later step fails, run compensating activities to reverse earlier committed work. This is the standard pattern for distributed transactions without two-phase commit. Each compensating activity is itself a durable activity call — if the compensation fails, it can also be retried or escalated.

```ballerina
@workflow:Workflow
function transferFunds(workflow:Context ctx, TransferInput input) returns string|error {
    // Step 1: commit the debit. `check` — if this fails there is nothing to compensate.
    string _ = check ctx->callActivity(debitAccount,
            {"accountId": input.sourceAccount, "amount": input.amount});

    // Step 2: capture as T|error so we can compensate on failure.
    string|error creditResult = ctx->callActivity(creditAccount,
            {"accountId": input.destAccount, "amount": input.amount},
            retryOnError = true, maxRetries = 2, retryDelay = 1.0);

    if creditResult is error {
        // Step 2 exhausted retries — reverse the debit to restore consistency
        string _ = check ctx->callActivity(reverseDebit,
                {"accountId": input.sourceAccount, "amount": input.amount});
        return string `Transfer ${input.transferId} ROLLED_BACK`;
    }

    return string `Transfer ${input.transferId} COMPLETED`;
}
```

### Graceful Completion — Tolerate Non-Critical Failures

When the failed activity is not required for the core business outcome (e.g., an audit log, a notification), skip it and let the workflow complete successfully.

```ballerina
@workflow:Workflow
function processOrder(workflow:Context ctx, OrderInput input) returns string|error {
    // CRITICAL — must succeed. Propagate failure with `check`.
    string reservationId = check ctx->callActivity(reserveInventory,
            {"orderId": input.orderId, "item": input.item});

    // NON-CRITICAL — tolerate failure. Retry once; skip if still failing.
    string|error emailResult = ctx->callActivity(sendConfirmationEmail,
            {"email": input.customerEmail, "orderId": input.orderId},
            retryOnError = true, maxRetries = 1, retryDelay = 1.0);
    if emailResult is error {
        return reservationId + " (email skipped: " + emailResult.message() + ")";
    }

    return reservationId + "; email: " + emailResult;
}
```

## Forward Recovery — Human in the Loop

When an activity fails due to a condition that code alone cannot resolve (e.g., a payment dispute, a compliance hold, an ambiguous data state), you can pause the workflow and wait for a human decision rather than failing immediately. This is called **forward recovery**: instead of rolling back, you hold state and let a person decide how to proceed.

### Define the Decision Event

```ballerina
type ReviewDecision record {|
    string reviewerId;
    boolean approved;     // true = retry the failed step; false = cancel the order
    string? note;
|};
```

### Pause and Wait After Failure

```ballerina
@workflow:Workflow
function orderProcess(
    workflow:Context ctx,
    OrderInput input,
    record {| future<ReviewDecision> review; |} events
) returns OrderResult|error {
    // Attempt payment with retries
    string|error paymentResult = ctx->callActivity(chargeCard,
            {"amount": input.amount, "cardToken": input.cardToken},
            retryOnError = true, maxRetries = 3, retryDelay = 2.0);

    if paymentResult is error {
        // Payment exhausted retries — notify the review team and pause
        check ctx->callActivity(notifyReviewTeam, {
            "orderId": input.orderId,
            "reason": paymentResult.message()
        });

        // Workflow pauses here until a human sends the "review" event
        ReviewDecision decision = check wait events.review;

        if !decision.approved {
            return {
                orderId: input.orderId,
                status: "CANCELLED",
                message: "Cancelled by " + decision.reviewerId + ": " + (decision.note ?: "")
            };
        }

        // Human approved a retry — attempt payment one more time
        string retryPayment = check ctx->callActivity(chargeCard,
                {"amount": input.amount, "cardToken": input.cardToken});
        return {orderId: input.orderId, status: "COMPLETED", message: retryPayment};
    }

    return {orderId: input.orderId, status: "COMPLETED", message: paymentResult};
}
```

### Send the Decision from an HTTP Endpoint

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/workflow;

map<string> activeWorkflows = {};

service /orders on new http:Listener(9090) {
    resource function post .(OrderInput request) returns json|error {
        string workflowId = check workflow:run(orderProcess, request);
        activeWorkflows[request.orderId] = workflowId;
        return {status: "started", workflowId};
    }

    // Called by a reviewer from an internal dashboard
    resource function post [string orderId]/review(ReviewDecision decision) returns json|error {
        string? workflowId = activeWorkflows[orderId];
        if workflowId is () {
            return error("No active workflow for order: " + orderId);
        }
        check workflow:sendData(orderProcess, workflowId, "review", decision);
        return {status: "decision received"};
    }
}
```

While the workflow is paused waiting for `events.review`, it is fully durable. If the workflow worker restarts, the workflow replays from its history and returns to the `wait` point exactly.

## Recovering Workflows via Temporal UI

The Temporal Web UI gives operators direct visibility into workflow failures and provides several tools for manual recovery without requiring code changes or redeployments.

### Inspect a Failed Workflow

1. Open the Temporal Web UI (default: `http://localhost:8233`)
2. Navigate to **Workflows** and filter by status **Failed** or **Timed Out**
3. Click a workflow to see its **Event History** — the `ActivityTaskFailed` event shows the error message, error type, and any detail fields your activity returned
4. The exact Ballerina error message and cause chain are serialized into the failure payload and displayed here

### Reset to a Previous Point

A **workflow reset** replays the workflow from a chosen event, discarding history after that point. Use this when:
- The activity failed due to a bug that has since been fixed
- A transient infrastructure issue caused repeated failures and you want to retry from a known-good state

Steps:
1. In the workflow detail view, click **Reset Workflow**
2. Select the event to reset to — typically the last `WorkflowTaskCompleted` event before the failed activity was scheduled
3. Confirm the reset — Temporal creates a new workflow run from that point, carrying forward all history up to the reset event

After resetting, the workflow worker will pick up the new run and execute the activity again with the fixed code.

### Terminate and Restart

If the workflow state is corrupt or the reset point is unclear, terminate the failed workflow and start a new one with corrected input:

1. In the workflow detail view, click **Terminate Workflow** and provide a reason
2. Start a fresh workflow run via your application API or by calling `workflow:run()` directly with the corrected input

Termination is permanent — it marks the workflow **Terminated** and stops all execution. Use it as a last resort when reset is not appropriate.

### Signal a Paused Workflow

If your workflow is waiting for a human-in-the-loop event (as shown above), you can send the signal directly from the Temporal UI without going through your HTTP API:

1. Open the running workflow's detail view
2. Click **Send Signal**
3. Enter the signal name (must match the field name in the events record, e.g., `"review"`)
4. Paste the JSON payload matching the event type (e.g., `{"reviewerId": "ops-1", "approved": true, "note": "manually approved"}`)
5. Click **Send** — the workflow resumes immediately

This is useful during incidents when the normal signal delivery path is unavailable.
